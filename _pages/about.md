Hello! I'm Guanwen Xie, a first-grade graduate student from Tsinghua University, supervised by Prof. Daoyi Chen and Yong Ren. Before this, I've obtained B. Eng. of ocean technology in Zhejiang University, supervised by Prof. Dongfang Ma.

Since my undergraduate studies, I have been passionate about underwater robotics. My interest lies in integrating the ocean with the latest advancements in reinforcement learning and machine learning, such as learning from demonstrations (LfD) and experience mining, intelligent large language models(LLMs) , etc. I continuously explore new possibilities and strive to make research outcomes as universal and user-friendly as possible for researchers.

Feel free to email me at [gwxie360@outlook.com](mailto:gwxie360@outlook.com) !

# üíª Miscellaneous

I have a passion for computer-related knowledge and have a wide range of interests. I enjoy video editing and used to be a video uploader on a website called [bilibili](https://space.bilibili.com/21927744/), where I uploaded fun videos about computer knowledge and computer viruses. Up to 2019.6, I gained 22k+ subscribers, ranking within the top 10,000 of bilibili. During my university experiences, I accumulated two years of computer repair experience within the electrical volunteer association(EVA) of Zhejiang University. I also love running and during my college years, I keep running 10 kilometers daily during the winter vacation of final year of undergraduate study. These experiences have taught me that no matter how difficult the situation, I have the courage to persevere!
